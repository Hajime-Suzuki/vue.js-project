    'Hi, Iâ€™m Hajime, from Tokyo and I love making things. I initially came to The Netherlands in 2014, to study music. I started learning to program by myself a few months before arriving and now, my main interest has shifted towards programming.',
    "At the moment, I am working as a freelance musician, music teacher and web developer but I would like to focus more on programming. I feel limited, being a freelance programmer without proper education since I'm doing it all by myself, without colleagues to turn to or learn from. I am looking forward to getting comprehensive knowledge and working with you through this course. I can't wait!"

    'Woodworking brings me both refreshment and productivity. I work with the desk, cook with the cutting board, and type on the keyboards that I have crafted by myself. I love using things that are customized to my liking. Of coures, I also have a great time during the process of making them. It is like a moment of "Zen" for me.',
